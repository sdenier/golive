# GoLive

Small Angular app for non-interactive display of live results:

- poll results in json format and refresh
- display each course/set in a column
- autoscroll each column so that all data have a chance to show

### Todos

- only check/refresh after scroll end?
- don't poll/refresh results unless all columns have at least one full pass
- plugins Brunch (minifier...)
